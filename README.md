# Crime-Rate-Dashboard-MongoDB-

This repository hosts the code and resources for analyzing global crime rates and creating interactive visualizations. The project leverages MongoDB Charts to build insightful dashboards and analyze crime-related metrics such as the crime index, safety index, and various criminality scores.

## Project Overview
The dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive way to analyze crime data across countries, highlighting key metrics like:

**Crime Index by Country:** Compare the perceived crime levels across different countries.
**Safety Index:** Visualize the perceived safety of each country.
**Criminality Scores Breakdown:** Understand the contribution of various factors such as criminal markets and actors.
**Resilience Score:** Assess a country's ability to combat crime and maintain order.
**Heatmap Analysis:** Identify high and low values for multiple crime dimensions across countries.
